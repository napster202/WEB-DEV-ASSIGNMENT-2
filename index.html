  <div id="his">The Galactic Empire, also known as the First Galactic Empire or the New Order, or simply the Empire or the Order, and remembered as the Old Empire, was the galactic, autocratic government that processed a galaxy-wide empire which replaced the Galactic Republic in the aftermath of the Clone Wars.

  Rising to power in the final years of the Republic, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious gradually secured the government under his control through the persona of Sheev Palpatine, the last Supreme Chancellor of the Republic. Through his machinations as both Sidious and Palpatine, the Sith were restored to a position of dominance amidst the fall of the Jedi Order and the marginalization of the Galactic Senate. Without the Jedi guardians of peace and justice to oppose him, Sidious brought an end to a thousand years of democracy; in its place he installed the absolute rule of himself as Galactic Emperor.</div>
